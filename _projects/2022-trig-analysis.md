As part of a final project for the class MAE 3260 System Dynamics, I collaborated with my group to create a simplified model of a satellite’s attitude dynamics and examine the effects of environmental disturbance torques, sensors, and actuators. The combined analysis provides a conceptual framework for understanding how satellites maintain orientation and stability through an Attitude Determination and Control System.
