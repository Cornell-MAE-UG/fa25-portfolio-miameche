This dissection video examines the internal components and fluid mechanics of a pneumatic grinder, focusing on how compressed air is converted into high-speed rotational motion. The video walks through the airflow path from the air inlet, through the throttle valve, and into the motor chamber, where expanding air drives a vane or turbine system. Key components such as the rotor, vanes, exhaust ports, and housing are identified and discussed in terms of pressure, flow direction, and energy transfer. The dissection highlights how design choices affect efficiency, torque, and speed, and explains how exhaust airflow and lubrication influence performance and heat dissipation. Overall, the video connects the physical structure of the grinder to the fluid-mechanical principles that allow it to operate effectively.
